This is the frontend of the deltacommunication.xyz website. The goal with this website was to create a website for a local network provider. Reason being that they were lacking an official website so I offered to create one to test out my django and react skills. The website was a success from a developer end, everything is working perfectly. The frontend was made using reactJS, backend using django and the code cannot be shared due to keeping the database private.
